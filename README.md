# RECIPEAS

### Purpose:
Recipeas is a simple web application where users are able to explore, search, filter, and upload cooking recipes.
The app allows users to filter recipes based on dish type, time, ingredients, and creator.
Each recipe card can be clicked to show an expanded view which includes more information.
You are also able to save recipes, and can view those saves in a separate page.
Finally, you can upload your own recipes to expand the platform.
